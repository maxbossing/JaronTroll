### Verify the integrity of the files

To verify the integrity download the SHA256SUM file and compare the sums of the jar with:

```
sha256sum JaronTroll.jar > /dev/null && sha256sum -c SHA256SUM
```

if the output looks like this

```
JaronTroll.jar OK
```

You're good to go

> If you dont use linux, go figure out for yourself how to do this
